# SQL-Challenge

This Challenge was an excerise in utilizing SQL via PgAdmin to establish tables, import data, and analyze it. We also were taksed with creating a ERD of the tables we created. My ERD was created using the QuickDBD website, and displays each table, their respective relationships, as well as the primary, foreign and composite keys. In PgAdmin, the CREATE TABLES function was used to create each table and define their respective columns, as well whether the table in question had a primary key, foreign key, or composite key. Once the tables were created, each CSV file was imported to it's respective data table by selecting the table in the left-side menu, then by right-clicking on the table name. From there, the import/export option was selcted, and Each CSV file was then individually imported to its respective table from the Data file, which is included in this repository. From there queries were created using the SELECT, FROM and WHERE functions to answer a series of data analysis questions. JOINS were also utlized in order to answer questions regarding more than one table.
